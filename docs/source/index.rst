BESSER Web Modeling Editor documentation
=========================================

The **BESSER Web Modeling Editor (WME) Standalone** is a complete toolkit for
modelling BESSER-compliant diagrams in the browser and sharing them through an
optional collaboration server. It builds on the `@besser/wme <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@besser/wme>`_
engine and augments it with workflow automation, template management, an
extensible front-end, and production-ready deployment artifacts.

This documentation set is organised into thematic collections so that readers
can quickly deep-dive into the area that matters most:

* **Getting started** walks through installation, configuration, and a guided
  tour of the editor.
* **User guides** cover everyday modelling tasks, keyboard shortcuts, sharing
  flows, and ways to extend the workspace.
* **Platform internals** describe how packages in this repository compose the
  standalone experience and how data flows through the system.
* **Backend** documentation explains the Express-based collaboration server,
  REST APIs, storage adapters, and operational tooling.
* **Frontend** documentation details the React application, store management,
  theming approach, and integration with the modelling engine.
* **Deployment** topics outline reference topologies for static hosting,
  multi-service setups, and observability.
* **Development** guides provide contributor onboarding, coding standards,
  release management, and quality gates.
* **Operations and Reference** sections cover CLI scripts, environment
  variables, and day-two responsibilities.
* **Appendix** gathers FAQs, glossaries, and troubleshooting recipes.
